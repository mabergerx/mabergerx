<h1 align="center">Welcome to my page üòÅ</h1>

Hi, my name is Mark!

I am a University of Amsterdam master's graduate, Data Scientist, & Data Engineer with interest in all things AI,
intellligent and interactive systems, information retrieval and human-machine interaction.
Also, [well designed data visualizations](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo) can
make me really happy and curious :)

Lately I have also been interested and involved in the topics of responsible and sustainable AI. To be more proactive, I
co-initiated [aitopia](aitopia.world), a platform for engagement on the topics of green, ethical and responsible AI!
